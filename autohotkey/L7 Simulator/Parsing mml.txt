Parsing mml is going to be a little tricky

it is a context sensitive tag-based tree structure

for menus that are not "final", there may be pages of up to 6 buttons
the language buttons draw with no icon - the menu item's title text is centered on a color gradient button
if an icon is specified, there is a semi-transparent button, icon on the left of it, then a split line - title on top, sub-text on bottom

for menus that are "final", a flip widget screen displays the menu items and links to a detail page of the same items
-i'm not sure where the thumbnail text comes from... (it comes from the same node marked final - it uses the title, subtext, and poster for the thumbnail - and the poster and text fields for the collateral)
the play button is a drawn button similar to the language buttons
