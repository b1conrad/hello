known issues
-------------
I have an unknown amount of possible text lines (it could vary, but usually doesn't) each with potentially different font sizes varying per player/airline... update textbox may not work because it is unknown how many textboxes will be needed from one synopsis to the next...
you also can't *just* destroy an individual control and re-populate it.. you have to destroy the whole gui and recreate it...
well... maybe that's what I have to do any time the synopsis text changes... ALL BECAUSE THERE IS NO HTML / RTF CONTROL IN AHK!!!
...so, if we have to re-create the gui on synopsis update, we need to maintain the state of everything else (dropdown list selections) on re-creation

This does not currently mirror an actual player's menu structure - just the collateral screens for everything it can find a synopsis text file for in the folder
-it depends on player integration to be at the stage where their text and image files have been created and put in the expected integration folders 
the L10 layout is not correct - this sets everything up as though it were an L7
-the collateral image and text size is also wrong for L10
XT players (Garuda) also do not display properly

v2
--
Re-positioned layout of L7 GUI elements to more closely match a real L7
Added a dropdown for language subfolders that is generated on the fly to allow language selection
-version 1 could only find collateral for a player if it was sppecifically in the \eng subfolder
Text box now handles the & character correctly
Poster images are now located more reliably 
-according to the name mangling convention for multiples of the same series or movie by appending count digits to the end of filename
The <br/> character in Eng/Arabic and Eng/French synopsis text (Gulf Air, Ethiopia) now create the intended line break, starting the foreign synopsis on the next line
