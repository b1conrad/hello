requires 
pip install python-Levenshtein
pip install fuzzywuzzy

in order to get these to run,


Cygwin:
make sure you have pip, and that when called from Cygwin, it runs on Cygwin's Python, not Windows' Pyhthon installation
ie: if "which pip" on the Cygwin command line does not return "/usr/bin/pip" then pip is going to install to some place other than Cygwin (most likely to your Windows' Python)
if this is the case, you'll need to install pip as follows:
download get-pip.py
python get-pip.py

If after successfully installing python-Levenshtein or fuzzywuzzy, you still cannot import the module (make sure you spell Levenshtein correctly),
then you probably had pip installing to the Windows' Python (check "which pip" on the Cygwin command line)


Windows:
python-Levenshtein requires pip to be able to find a C++ compiler to compile its un-compiled C++ code parts
this works fine on Cygwin/Linux because it just uses the one in /usr/bin,
but Windows does not have a C++ compiler that it can access out of the box, so, you have to install one
specifically, on Windows, pip will try to find the same version of Visual C++ compiler (2008) that your version of Python (2.7 in our case) was compiled with
fortunately, if all you need is a C++ compiler for installing 3rd party Python libraries that reference un-compiled C++ code, 
you don't need to install the entire bloated Visual Studio 2008 express just to get a 64 bit version of VC++2008 compiler or even install and configure VC++2008
Microsoft actually released a special bare-bones pre-configured light-weight installation of VC++2008 specifically for Python 2.7 for people who need to address just this issue.
just download and run the Windows installer file: 
VCForPython27.msi
...and don't forget to restart your computer when you're done! 
otherwise pip might not be able to see your newly-installed VC compiler in the system registry and may behave as though VC is not installed on your machine until you reboot

HOWEVER - unless you have setuptools 6.0.2 or greater installed, it will still not work. 
to install setuptools 6.0.2, download it, unzip it, then from the folder that has setup.py,
python setup.py install

If you're still getting an error like "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat" from pip on attempting to installing your Python library at the Windows command prompt,
then either you did not install VCForPython27.msi, or did not reboot your computer, or did not update your setuptools to 6.0.2 or greater.
