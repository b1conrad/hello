To run the echo client/server, open two terminal windows.

Run
python echoserver.py
on the terminal you want to act as server.

Run
python echoclient.py
on the terminal you want to act as client.

If you want to run the client from a different machine than the server, you need to change the connectTCP parameter from "localhost" to the IP of the remote machine you are running echoserver.py on.
