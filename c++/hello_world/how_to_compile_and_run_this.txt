How to compile:

g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world.exe

Note: use g++ specifically to compile C++ code - not gcc (even though it can)


Easier still, for simple one file projects, you can also just do:

make hello_world

Note: NOT "make hello_world.cpp" - you have to omit the extension!

(even if there is no Makefile, as long as the arg is the same name minus extension as the cpp file)

---------------------------

How to run:

At the command line, enter:
./hello_world

Note: The compiler makes the binary file executable by default, so you shouldn't have to chmod 755 it like you otherwise would have to if writing a script
